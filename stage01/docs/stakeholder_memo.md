# Stakeholder Memo — ETF Strategy Sustainability

**To:** Chief Investment Officer  
**From:** Quantitative Research Team  
**Subject:** Will the ETF Strategy Still Work Next Year?

## Context & Decision
We must decide whether to continue, scale, or retire the current ETF strategy for the next fiscal year.  
This decision will be made in the Q4 strategy meeting and directly impacts portfolio allocation.

## Deliverable
A predictive analysis combining historical backtests, factor exposure review, and macroeconomic scenario modeling, delivered as a written report with visual dashboards.

## Success Criteria
- Model shows ≥60% probability of outperforming benchmark next year  
- Projected Sharpe ratio ≥1.2 under baseline scenario

## Assumptions & Constraints
- Historical ETF data available for at least 5 years  
- Macroeconomic indicators accessible from approved sources  
- No insider information; compliance rules applied  
- Report delivered 3 weeks before Q4 meeting

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Market regime change** → scenario stress testing  
- **Macro shocks** → sensitivity analysis  
- **Data gaps** → use secondary public datasets
